# Mandarin

Deckbuilder. A retort to dominion derivatives, where you dump your hand. Also slightly to millennium blades, which is technically a 'handbuilder'.

## How to play

Read the rules from the rules folder, print some cards from the cards folder or boot up tabletop simulator.

Intended reading order is `flow.md`, `cards.md`, `buying.md` and `playing.md`, but it isn't set in stone in any sense. Refering to the rules mid-game it also acceptable, but generally having at least a minor grasp of how the game works beforehand makes the experience flow smoother.

## Rules

Found in the rules folder.

## Cards
