# Implicit

This file describes the implicit actions players and cards have.

## Player

### Buying cards

Players can spend money to buy cards. Cards bought are usually put to the top of the buyer's deck.

### Playing cards

Players may play cards by paying their mana costs and any additional costs the card has. After that the card goes to the top of the stack. More on the stack in `stack.md` and `terms.md` stack zone part.

### Obliterate cards

Players can choose to simply annihilate any cards they are holding in their hands. This serves a two-fold purpose. The first one is to compensate the tendency of 'the discard color' being quite strong in deckbuilders, since your starting deck is purposefully bad and thus getting rid of it makes the rest of your deck better. The second purpose is as a method of handling misplay. When a card is illegally revealed from hand, the revealing player has two options. Pay the costs of the card and take it back into their hand (works when the problem was targeting) or they may obliterate the card. A method of punishing misplay is needed, since it will make nobody seem like the asshole when demanding others to play according to the rules.

## Creatures

### Attacking

### Defending

### Untapping

All creatures have an implicit triggered ability.

"start of your turn: untap self" 

Please note that only creatures have this ability. A post must be crewed to untap.
