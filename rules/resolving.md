# Resolving

## Costs

Costs are linked to effects. If a cost can be fully resolved, the rest of the ability will resolve.

## Effects

This file describes how effects resolve. Note, that this file doesn't concern itself on how multiple effects interact, only on how to 'run' a single card text. In short, if an action cannot be completed, it can be ignored and moved on. Each effect is completed as far as it can be.

For example, if you have 2 cards in your deck, but an effect states 'draw 3. destroy target human'. You will draw the two cards in your deck and get to destroy a human, even though the draw did not 'complete'. But if the same text was a cost, you wouldn't get to destroy target human, since the resolving stopped after drawing failed to complete.
