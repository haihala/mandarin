# Cards

This file describes card types and card regions.

## Types

Cards come in a few different types. Card types are descriptions of the cards' interfaces.

### Creature

Can attack other players and operate things.

Example creature is a bit harder to define when combat isn't fleshed out, but think of any common creature from mtg.

### Post

A building that needs a crew to operate and does something large-ish. For more on crewing, check out `keywords.md`

I'll give two examples, since usually posts should be either activated or passive.

Example of an active post could be a battering ram that needs a crew and then has an activated ability to destroy another post.

Example of a passive post could be a toll booth that requires all players to pay one mana each time a card changes a zone or the controller gets a gold token.

### Attachment

Something that is attached to something and works passively.

Example attachment could attach to posts and deal one damage to each crew member at the end of the turn until removed.

### Momentary

Does something, is discarded afterwards.

Example momentary could draw two cards and then go to the graveyard.

### Land

Quite similar to the ones in mtg. More often utility based and the differences in mana carry over.
