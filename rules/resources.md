# Resources

Resources are defined as a material to consume. They are sorted into direct and indirect resources based on whether or not they are used for something other than paying for various things. This file only describes how direct resources work.

## Both

Both gold and mana:

* Are cleared from your pool at the end of each turn.
* Are atomic and cannot be split.

## Gold

Gold is the primary currency for buying new cards from the market. Players automatically gain three gold at the start of their turn.

## Mana

Mana is magical energy used to play your cards. Unlike mana in hearthstone, all mana isn't equal and unlike the mana in mtg mana can be more granual than just of a certain color. Sources can tag the mana they provide to make it have special properties. All mana still count as mana and if something only demands generic mana then anything will work.

For example, a farmland will provide one food mana. This can be used as just a unit of mana, or as a food mana for something that specifically needs food mana.

A source could tag their mana in multiple ways. For example an enchanted farmland could produce magical food mana. Mana is mostly produced from tapping land. Land itself can cost mana to play.
