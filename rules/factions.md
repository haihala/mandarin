# Factions

Factions are the closest thing to mtg colors. Different factions have strengths and weaknesses in addition to their own philosophy

Accurate descriptions of faction mechanics can be found in `keywords.md`

## Philosophy

Philosophy of the factions works in axis. The essential axis are:

1. individual - group
2. Intellectual - Physical
3. Outward - Inward
4. Cooperation - Hinderance
5. Innovation - Preservation

Philosophies lop in order 12345, each neighbor agrees with the main point of the primary and each one that isn't a neigbor opposes the viewpoint. To agree is to belive the first half, to disagree is to belive the second.

So a faction that has 1 as their base philosophy, also agrees with 2 and 5, while opposing 3 and 4.
