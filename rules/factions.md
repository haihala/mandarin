# Factions

Factions are the closest thing to mtg colors. Different factions have strengths and weaknesses in addition to their own philosophy

Accurate descriptions of faction mechanics can be found in `keywords.md`

## Philosophy

Philosophy of the factions works in axis. The essential axis are:

1. Freedom of the individual - Safety of the group
2. Innovation of new - Preservation of old
3. Outward disruption - Inward growth
4. Intellectual superiority - Physical prowess
5. Succumbing to nature - Enviromental mastery

From now on, A is the left side B is the right side, so 4B refers to 'Physical prowess'. Each faction has a philosophy table like so:

1. A
2. a
3. a
4. b
5. b

Capital letters refer to a big part of identity. Each axis must only have one strong faction. Each faction must have one capital viewpoint and each viewpoint must be split 3/2 in favor of the capital.
