# Flow

Roughly, game is setup first and then players take turns until everyone either won or lost.

A player is the winner if:

* A card states so
* All other players have lost

## Setup

Proceed to the next step after previous one is complete.

1. Each player gets a starter set of cards and three cards from the top of the market deck.
2. Players shuffle their cards.
3. Deal six cards from the market deck.
4. Decide who goes first. The rules won't dictate how you do this.
5. Starting player takes their turn, move to the recurring section.

## Turn

1. Draw
2. Play cards, activate abilities and buy new cards according to rules.
3. Pass the turn.

End and start of turn triggers happen after passing and before the next player drawing. End of turn triggers happen before start of turn triggers of the next player.
