# Stack

You can play a card or use an ability if:

* You can pay for the cost
* Your effect is fast enough
* You have priority

## What is fast enough?

Some cards have the 'fast' type. These cards can be played as a reaction to other cards. Some cards have the subtype 'breakneck', which is an even faster card.

Here is a table of what can react to what:

|What is on top|Can I use a basic effect|Can I use a fast effect|Can I use a breakneck effect|
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|nothing|yes|yes|yes|
|basic|no|yes|yes|
|fast|no|yes|yes|
|breakneck|no|no|yes|

So basically, a card can always be played as a reaction to a slower card and non-basic cards can react to cards with the same speed.

Some activatable abilities are also fast. This is shown individually in the ability, but the default is that they are basic speed.

## Priority and resolving stacks

Basically, priority is the 'permission to act'. Exactly one player has priority at a time.

When something is put on the stack, start or restart the following algorithm: 

1. Priority is passed from the player who put whatever just went on the stack there. 
2. All players get to have priority. (even the instigator)
3. The top effect resolves. If there are no more effects on the stack, turn owner gains priority and stack resolving exits.
4. Priority passes until the player whose effect is on top of the stack passes.
5. Go to step 3.


To clarify, the player who put something on the stack cannot act immediately afterwards, but gains priority before their effect resolves.
