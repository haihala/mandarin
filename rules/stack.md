# Stack

This file describes how the stack works. Some cards have the 'fast' type. These cards can be played as a reaction to other cards. Some cards have the subtype 'breakneck', which is an even faster card.

Here is a table of what can react to what:

Base card is row, column is reacting card

|can I|play a basic|play a fast|play a breakneck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|on a basic|no|yes|yes|
|on a fast|no|yes|yes|
|on a breakneck|no|no|yes|

So basically, a card can always be played as a reaction to a slower card and non-basic cards can react to cards with the same speed.
