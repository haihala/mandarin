# Stack

This file describes how the stack works. Some cards have the 'fast' type. These cards can be played as a reaction to other cards. Some cards have the subtype 'breakneck', which is an even faster card.

Here is a table of what can react to what:

|Can I play|basic|fast|breakneck|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|when the top card is basic|no|yes|yes|
|when the top card is fast|no|yes|yes|
|when the top card is breakneck|no|no|yes|

So basically, a card can always be played as a reaction to a slower card and non-basic cards can react to cards with the same speed.
