# Terms

This file describes terminology that comes with the game. Similar to `keywords.md`, but for concepts.

## Play order

A way to sort players. The first player is the one whose turn it is and after that players go in the order the table rotates in.

## Zone

In short, a zone is a gameplay area where cards can exist. All existing zone types are listed below. Amount of cards in a zone is public information, but the cards themselves are often not.

Shorthands:

* Ordered
	* Order of cards in this zone matters.
* Unordered
	* Not ordered
* Public
	* Specific cards in a zone are public information. For example the board.
* Hidden
	* Not public

### Deck

Ordered hidden zone.
Zone you use to store cards. Provides a random element to the game. Cards you aquire go to the top, sometimes cards go to the bottom.
All access to the deck is relative to either the top or the bottom. A card can be placed in the deck Nth from the top, but not 'in the middle'

### Hand

Unordered hidden zone.
Zone you use to store cards you can play. A source of hidden information and psychology.

### Board

Unordered public zone.
Zone you use to store 'active' cards you control

### Market

Ordered public zone.

### Graveyard

Unordered public zone.


### Vanish

Unordered public zone.
Cards moved to this zone are gone. They cannot be accessed and their abilities cannot be used. There is nothing that can ever bring them back.

### Stash

Stashes can be ordered or unordered, public or hidden.
The stash isn't a singular zone, but a collection of zones that are mostly used to temporarily remove things from play.
