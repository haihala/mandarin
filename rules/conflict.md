# Conflict

This file describes how conflicts are resolved. If something is missed, it shall be missed. If a player draws before resolving their start of turn triggers, they are unable to resolve them now.

## Resolution conflicts

1. Card beats generic rule.
2. Preventing something beats doing it
3. Conflicting statics resolve in the play order. If a player controls multiple ones they may freely choose the application order separately for each event.

## Human error

### Illegal actions

If a card is played illegally and the illegality is realized when the card is being played, the player may pay the cards play cost(s) and return it to their hand, if they decide not to or are unable to do so, they must obliterate the card.

If everyone at the table misses the illegality at the time of play, the game proceeds like the card was played legally.

The same rules apply for all abilities that would reveal hidden information. Playing cards is an ability of the player.

### Missed triggers

If a player completes the action normally following the triggers resolution before noticing the trigger, it is considered missed and thus voided. For example, if a player controls something with a start of turn trigger, they are not allowed to resolve that after they draw their card for the turn. 

### Undoing activatable abilities

Costs must be played before anything happens. After costs have been paid, the action cannot be canceled. However the illegal actions rule applies if the ability had already revealed hidden information.
